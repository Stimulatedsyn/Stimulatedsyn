# Adaptive Node Network Architecture (ANNA)

## Overview

The Adaptive Node Network Architecture (ANNA) is a dynamic system composed of various interconnected nodes that perform specific functions such as perception, knowledge management, processing, learning, and action execution. ANNA is designed to adapt to new challenges and optimize its performance through node reconfiguration, cloning, and specialization.

## Node Types

- **Perception Node (PN)**: Processes input data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Knowledge Node (KN)**: Manages a knowledge graph to store and retrieve knowledge entities and their attributes.
- **Processing Node (PRN)**: Uses a Decision Tree Classifier for data processing.
- **Learning Node (LN)**: Implements a Q-learning algorithm to learn and choose actions based on state-action values.
- **Action Node (AN)**: Plans and executes actions based on decisions made by other nodes.

## Core Features

1. **Dynamic Node Network**: A flexible network of nodes that can be reconfigured based on performance.
2. **Node Cloning and Specialization**: Nodes can be cloned and specialized to improve the network's adaptability and performance.
3. **Adaptive Communication**: Nodes communicate and transmit data using adaptive connection weights.

## Implementation

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install numpy keras scikit-learn
```

### Code Structure

1. **Node Classes**:
    - `PerceptionNode`: Handles perception using a CNN.
    - `KnowledgeNode`: Manages a knowledge graph.
    - `ProcessingNode`: Processes data using a Decision Tree Classifier.
    - `LearningNode`: Implements a Q-learning algorithm.
    - `ActionNode`: Plans and executes actions.

2. **NodeNetwork Class**:
    - Manages the dynamic network of nodes.
    - Handles node reconfiguration, cloning, and specialization.
    - Transmits data between nodes using adaptive weights.

3. **Test Functions**:
    - `test_evolving_structure()`: Tests node reconfiguration and cloning.
    - `final_system_test()`: Integrates and tests the entire ANNA system.
    - `test_scenario()`: Transmits data through the network to verify data processing.

### Running the Code

1. **Save the Code**:
    - Save the implementation into a file named `anna_system.py`.

2. **Execute the File**:
    - Run the file using Pydroid 3's terminal or editor:

    ```sh
    python anna_system.py
    ```

### Example Usage

```python
# Run tests
test_evolving_structure()
final_system_test()
```

### Expected Output

```
Evolving structure test passed
Scenario test passed
Final system test passed
```
