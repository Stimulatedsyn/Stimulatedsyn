**About Me(LIAR)**

**I'm an AI enthusiast, a coding ninja in training(CRINGE), and a bacon-loving autodidact. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.**

**Here's what you can expect from me:**
* ***im just kidding my life sucks, i have very little marketable skills, i am homeless and i sleep in my car.***
* **A thirst for knowledge:** I'm currently exploring the vast landscape of programming languages, and I've found Python to be particularly enjoyable (it's like the Mountain Dew of coding!). I'm eager to expand my skills and master new tools as I delve deeper into the world of AI.
* **A passion for innovation:** I'm always looking for new ways to use AI to solve real-world problems. I'm not afraid to experiment and try new things, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone.
* **A collaborative spirit:** I enjoy working with other people to achieve common goals. I'm always open to feedback and willing to contribute my skills and expertise to help others succeed.
* **A sense of humor:** I believe that a little humor can go a long way. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself and I enjoy making others laugh too.

**Let's work together to build a better future with AI.**

**In addition to my burgeoning coding skills, I'm also a passionate learner and a lifelong student. I'm always eager to learn new things, even if they're not directly related to my work. I'm also a proud member of the Open Source community( IVE CONTRIBUTED NOTHING)and I'm committed to giving back to the community by contributing to open-source projects(IF THEY ARE IN MY INTERESTS OR CAN MAKE FOOD DOLLARS).**

**I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other AI enthusiasts( I JUST DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THOUGH) and developers( IM DEVELOPING HEMROIDS OR IM SITTING ON MY KEYS AGAIN). If you're interested in working with me(NOT WISE), or if you have any questions about my work, please feel free to reach out.**

**I'm also active on social media(no im not), so be sure to follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn to stay up-to-date on my latest projects and thoughts on AI.**

**Thank you for reading(MAYBE READ A BOOK TOO, I SURE WON'T)!**
